# MTA:SA Winter

This script replaces the textures of summer in San Andreas with snow textures. The script is very lightweight because, instead of using .txd files, I used images. In San Andreas, there are many duplicated textures that are equal, but with different file names. To address this, I hashed every image in the game and deleted the duplicates. As a result, the images only occupy **142MB** instead of gigabytes.
